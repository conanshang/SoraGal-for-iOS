This is a short demo for SoraGal for iOS.

The BGM (Background Music) will change, 
and display a new BG (Background).

@setBGM "06"

@setBG "EA01a"

蔚蓝的天空让人觉得异常清澈。不同城市的天空，纯粹的蓝。
(This is a dialog.)
(Sorry for the inconvience if you don't know Chinese, I can't get an English one.)

悠：......喂,你不吃点东西吗?
(This dialog is different from the previous one, for it shows name for the person who said it.)

The background will be changed, and the changing time is 300ms, which can be indicate on the script.

@setBG "EA09a",300

The background will be changed again, and the changing time is 3000ms.

@setBG "B07e",3000

The background image is not fit screen, but if you want to zoom it, change it in settings.
(To open the settings, just swipe up.)

The background display mode has changed, and you can see it in realy time.

Please focus on the display speed of the text. Lets change the speed.

话虽如此，可是穹从刚才就一直望着窗外的风景，一动也不动，而且也不理我。

她小口咀嚼着嘴里的食物，好像是在遮羞似的。

Do you see the difference ?

Well, lets change the background music, and adjust the volume.

@setBGM "08"

Finally, lets change the background image, and I'll show you the save game function.
(To save the game, just swipe left.)
