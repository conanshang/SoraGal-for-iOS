The BG (Background) will also change.

蔚蓝的天空让人觉得异常清澈。不同城市的天空，纯粹的蓝。
(This is a dialog.)
(Sorry for the inconvience if you don't know Chinese, I can't get an English one.)

悠：......喂,你不吃点东西吗?
(This dialog is different from the previous one, for it shows name for the person who said it.)

话虽如此，可是穹从刚才就一直望着窗外的风景，一动也不动，而且也不理我。
(Low speed.)

她小口咀嚼着嘴里的食物，好像是在遮羞似的。
(High speed.)

Do you see the difference ?

Well, lets change the background music, and adjust the volume.
